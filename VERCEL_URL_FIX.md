# üö® Vercel URL Issue - 404 NOT_FOUND

## Problem
Your deployment URL is showing a 404 error, which typically happens when:
1. The deployment failed
2. You're accessing a temporary deployment URL instead of the main domain
3. The project domain configuration needs to be updated

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix

### Step 1: Get Your Correct Production URL
Your main production URL should be: **https://aplls-2026-website.vercel.app**

### Step 2: Check Deployment Status
From the deployment list, I can see multiple deployments with different statuses:
- ‚úÖ Some are "Ready" (working)
- ‚ùå Some show "Error" (failed)

### Step 3: Access the Correct URL
Try these URLs in order:

1. **Main Production URL**: https://aplls-2026-website.vercel.app
2. **Latest Working Deployment**: https://aplls-2026-website-55ueafyz6-steadys-projects-8624b441.vercel.app

### Step 4: If Still Getting 404
If the main URL doesn't work, we need to:

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Find your `aplls-2026-website` project
   - Check the "Domains" section
   - Verify the production domain is set correctly

2. **Redeploy if Needed**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Check Build Logs**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, click on the latest deployment
   - Check the "Build Logs" for any errors

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The 404 error with ID `sin1::5j58d-1754834114547-78e49ab5cbc2` suggests:
- The deployment exists but the route/file is not found
- Possible build or routing issue
- The specific deployment URL might be from a failed build

## üéØ Expected Behavior

Once fixed, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Access https://aplls-2026-website.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ See the APLLS 2026 website homepage
- ‚úÖ Submit registrations successfully
- ‚úÖ Access admin panel at /admin.html

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Try the main production URL first
2. If it doesn't work, check Vercel dashboard
3. Look for the latest successful deployment
4. Redeploy if necessary

The Supabase integration we just fixed should work once you access the correct URL!
